# Chatbot Application

- **Dynamic Responses**: Based on user input, the chatbot provides appropriate responses.
- **Typing Animation**: Incorporates a typing animation effect using the `react-type-animation` library.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes `react-bootstrap` components for a responsive and modern UI.
